# SearchFunctionality
-> The automation script(ValidateSearch.Java)in here tests the search functionality. Here is the list of things it does:
	* Navigates to the browser.
	* Enters an input search string in the search box and click search.
	* Verifies if the number of results displayed is equal to the number of results that exists on the page.
	* Part of the script extracts the text of each result and verifies if it matches to input string. If it doesn’t match to the string it also provides the location of that specific result.
-> Test Case.pdf file consists of the test cases that are required to test this feature.
